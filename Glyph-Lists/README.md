Robofont script that prints various glyph Lists / based on RoboFab gString' glyph Lists
it imports the lists and dicts of glyphs from modules folder - these lists can be modified.
Dont change list names in modules.dicts - if you change lists and dict names in modules.dicts - you need to modify them in this script too.

If you click "Remove glyphs not in Font" - the script checks if the glyphs actually exist in your font -
make sure a font is open.

you can send displayed glyphs of your font in spacecenter / or open spacecenters for all open fonts.
