Robofont script that prints various glyph Lists / based on RoboFab gString' glyph Lists.
It imports the lists and dicts of glyphs from the modules folder - these lists can be modified and customized.
Don't change list names in modules.dicts.
If you change lists and dict names in modules.dicts - you need to modify them in this script too.

If you click "Remove glyphs not in Font" - the script checks if the glyphs actually exist in your font -
make sure a font is open.

Options:
• add the key glpyh to the dependencies outpout
• strip Slashes from output in order to create sets
• send displayed glyphs of your font in spacecenter / or open spacecenters for all open fonts.
• multiple spacecenter windows can be tiled if necessary

many thanks to Alexandre Saumier Demers for the improvements
